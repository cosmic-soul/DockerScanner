Placeholder for future TUI implementation using py-cui.

This module will be implemented in the future when a full
Terminal User Interface is needed.

NOTE: This file currently provides a placeholder implementation that
delegates to the interactive console. When implementing the full TUI,
uncomment the code and install the required dependencies.
